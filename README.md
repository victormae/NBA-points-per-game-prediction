# NBA-points-per-game-prediction: latent factors, predicting model all that was done to find it.
This Project follows steps to predict A points per game in an NBA game. It follows a scientific process examining and testing several models in the analysis to find latent variables used in building a final model that predicts points scored in an NBA game. Project is done in R.
Latent factors that were not immediately intuitive to the mind, affecting points per game were found. The effect of the synergies or counteraction (if on opposing teams) between the Shooting guard and the Center, seemed to be especially important. Other synergies between other position-pairings with the shooting guard like PF-SG, SF-SG, PG-SG in terms of assists, setting screens to give the SG room for field goal attempts etc., along with defensive rebounds, seem to be latent factors that affect the points per game. A regression model predicting points scored was built using the latent variables found. See pdf documment for details and R code file.
